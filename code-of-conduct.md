**TL;DR. Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable at a TechnoHacks event, if the event itself creates an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a TechnoHacks representative or event organizer makes you uncomfortable, please report it using the procedures in this document.**

TechnoHacks stands for inclusivity. Everyone has the right to hack in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, and veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but are not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, TechnoHacks staff, and anyone participating in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, TechnoHacks may take any appropriate action, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please get in touch with TechnoHacks using the reporting procedures defined below.

TechnoHacks representatives can help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe during the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions relating to the event, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon-supplied transportation.

## Reporting Procedures

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately using one of the following methods. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.

Email team@technohacks.org or talk to an organizer at the event to report an incident.

TechnoHacks reserves the right to revise, make exceptions to, or otherwise amend these policies in whole or in part. If you have any questions regarding these policies, don't hesitate to get in touch with TechnoHacks by e-mail at team@technohacks.org.
